# liri-node-app

This is a program where one can use node.js to put in one of four arguments. The code that will be executed will be based on what is put in.

# How It Works

If the following commands are put into the terminal, the following will happen:

1) "my-tweets" - The user will get the last 20 tweets and when they were created
2) "spotify-this-song" - The user will put in the name of a song and get the details of it: the artist, the song name, what album it comes from, and a link to preview that song. If no song was put in, Liri defaults to "The Sign".
3) "movie-this" - The user will get all the information from whatever movie was typed in. If nothing was typed in, LIRI defaults to Mr. Nobody.
4) "do-what-it-says" - LIRI will take text from a random text file and execute the command.
